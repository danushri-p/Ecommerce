mongoose(npm i mongoose):connect and interact with MongoDB, schema-based solution for data management.

cors (npm i cors):cross-origin requests are necessary for frontend-backend communications.

nodemon (npm i nodemon):automatically reboots the server on changing files, which makes further development more efficient.

After all these configurations, this project is ready for complete full-stack development.
