Ecommerce Application

Milestone 1: Project Overview

This project is a simple Ecommerce web application that includes core functionalities such as user authentication, product display, order management, and a payment gateway.

1. User Authentication: This is used for registration like log page

2. Product Page: This is used to displays the products

3. Order Page: This is used to show order details of each product

4. Payment Gateway:This is used to process the payment for the products ordered.

Milestone 2:

1.Setup Frontend:

1.Tailwind CSS(npm install -D tailwindcss)

React(npm create vite@latest frontend).
2.Set up the Backend

1.Initialization (npm init) This is for creating a package.json file which keeps track of all dependencies and metadata used by a project.

Installing packages express (npm i express ):Used for routing and handling the logic in a server.
mongoose(npm i mongoose):connect and interact with MongoDB, schema-based solution for data management.

cors (npm i cors):cross-origin requests are necessary for frontend-backend communications.

nodemon (npm i nodemon):automatically reboots the server on changing files, which makes further development more efficient.

After all these configurations, this project is ready for complete full-stack development.

Milestone 3:
1. Setting up the Node Server: You start by setting up a app.js server, usually with frameworks like Express

2. Connecting Your Application to MongoDB: MongoDB is a NoSQL database where you can store data in collections.

3. Establish Connection Between Database and Server: 
created a file name database.js and connected the database and server

4.Error Handling: Error handling ensures that if something goes wrong, the system can report where the problem occurred.


Happy coding!!
